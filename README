WebCrumbs is an analysis platform for web logs that are based on Requests.

To run WebCrumbs:
1. Install ant, if you don't already have it.
2. If on Windows put ant in your path.
3. Download webcrumbs.jar, build.xml and runWebCrumbs.bat
4. Run runWebCrumbs.bat

The data directory has some fun data files to play around with. WebCrumbs currently
supports both the HAR and FourthParty data formats. Adding your own file is easy with
pluggable Parsers (More on how to make your own Parser later). 

You can render and search through graphs using the WebCrumbs framework.

You can also plug in your own rankers which allow you to both change the color and the 
size of the nodes in the graph that you observe. 

WebCrumbs makes even the visualization libraries pluggable (more work to allow that fully is on 
my TODO list).
